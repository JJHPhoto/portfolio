# Portfolio
This week we were assigned a portfolio page that we would have to build from scratch. We were given an image of how things were supposed to look along with some colors to start with. We were told that this was going to be the portfolio we would be adding to over the course of the bootcamp. 

## My Workflow
<br>

### 1. Research.

I knew that I wanted to use flexbox to give myself options later on in the bootcamp. I dove into a few flexbox tutorials to try and get a feel for how that’d work. I also used Codepen to try and see what the site would look like before I began coding in VS. I also inspcected pages my classmates were sharing that they had done. 


### 2. Beginning code.
    a) Set up the initial structure in HTML with basic styling in CSS.
    b) Added breakpoints for media queries.

### 3. Issues and further research.
    a) Worked on my “header” styling and ran into issues due to not understanding flex.
    b) Did more research and prepared questions for my tutor. 

### 4. Personalizing page
    a) Decided to color the webpage how I wanted to after seeing our instructor say that the colors given were not required to be the same. 
    b) Got my header looking how I wanted. 
    c) Worked on my banner image & subtitle with my tutor. I knew that I could use the same principles for the other images on the page. 
    d) Used a phrase in Mandarin that my best friend taught me. It means "Get better each day." 
    e) Ran into issues in my "sections" due to still not having a good understanding of flex.
    f) Played around in Google dev tools till I figured out what I was doing wrong. 
    g) Added a poem for my “About Me” section that has been a favorite of mine since my best friend introduced it to me. 

### 5. Finishing up.
    a) After running into style issues, decided to create classes for most of the elements in my page with the thinking that I’d consolidate the code after I finished. 
    b) Ran into more issues positioning my sections, so I created separate sections for each row of photos. 
    c) Created my "Footer" with relevant links.
    d) Added hover effects to images and links.
    e) Linked my navbar to my sections. 
    f) Linked my "Work" images to sites I run or have portfolio work at.
