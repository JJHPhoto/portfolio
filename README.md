# Joshua Haller's Web Development Portfolio

I have archived the previous README file [here](./assets/ArchiveOne.md). I wanted to preserve this for reference. Feel free to check it out if you are interested.

## Update 2.0

One of the first things I wanted to do with this revision was to make my website responsive. I had it looking ok for desktop but it was not responsive at all the first time. I decided to use Boostrap because I found it to be the best frameworks to work in over the last two months.

Getting the navbar and jumbotron to work was fairly simple. I thought that the rest of the work would go smoothly. Unfortunately, I had a difficult time due to jumping right in and making changes. I should have done what I ended up doing: rebuiling most of the HTML and deleting a lot of the CSS. I would bring back elements like colors, centering, line height later on. Hopefully I can learn from this for the next revision.

I also made the mistake of not being in mobile mode when I was viewing my code in the browser. I really need to start from that position and see what needs to be changed once I switch to desktop mode. To quote the phrase that I've kept on the website: "一天比一天". Better today than yesterday. Which I know is true, its just sometimes hard to see.

The next thing I did was select two projects that I had done well in. One of the projects doesn't have a live link and I made a note of that.....

I chose to not put my phone number on my portfolio. I am very hesitant to post my phone number in public places. If that is an issue, I am willing to be convinced otherwise. However, I'm already getting a fair number of fake calls and texts. I'd rather not add to the list.

The last bit was to make sure my Github and LinkedIn were....
